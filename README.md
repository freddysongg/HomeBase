## Project Motivation
Managing shared responsibilities in a home environment, especially with roommates, can often lead to confusion and frustration. Many people struggle with task management, expense tracking, and ensuring that chores are evenly distributed. 

HomeBase is designed to simplify these tasks by providing an easy-to-use app that enables roommates to collaborate, split chores, track household expenses, and set reminders for various household tasks. The motivation behind this project is to improve household management for people living with roommates, making the experience more organized, efficient, and stress-free.

## Functional Requirements

### Chore Management
- Roommates can create and assign chores
- Each chore can have a due date and can be marked as completed
- Reminders are sent for upcoming chores
- Tasks can be rotated among roommates to ensure fairness

### Expense Tracking
- Users can record shared expenses like rent, groceries, utilities, etc.
- The app will calculate individual shares, ensuring all roommates pay their fair share
- Users can track paid and pending expenses

### Household Task List  
- Roommates can create and track general household tasks such as maintenance, cleaning, and other essential activities
- Each task can have a deadline and a status (in-progress, completed)

### User Profiles
- Each roommate will have a profile with their contact information and preferences
- Profiles can show chore completion history and expense contributions

### Notifications & Alerts
- The app sends notifications for upcoming chores, overdue tasks, and reminders about shared expenses
- Notifications ensure that everyone stays on track with their responsibilities

## If More Time Permits
- Enhanced features like chore prioritization (urgent vs. non-urgent)
- Advanced analytics for expense trends
- Integration with third-party payment systems like Venmo or PayPal  
- Social features, such as polls for group decisions
- Gamified rewards for task completion

## Feasibility Analysis

### Existing Tools & Frameworks

### Skills & Experience
Team members have experience in:
- Mobile/web development (React, JavaScript, and Python)
- Databases (SQL, Firebase) to manage user data and task tracking

### Time Management
- The project will be divided into smaller milestones
- Each team member will take ownership of specific features
- Basic functionality to be completed in first half of quarter
- User testing and improvements in second half

### Learning & Growth
The team is prepared to learn any new tools or technologies necessary to successfully complete the app, such as:
- Implementing push notifications
- Advanced user authentication

This makes the project realistic to complete within the allocated timeframe.
